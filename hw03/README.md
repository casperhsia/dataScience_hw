# Homework03 for Data Science in Practice
## Shinyapps.io
Using shinyapps by RStudio to shared the result of the plot. There are two R files: server and ui. The input data is in folder "inputData", and it's from [HW02](https://github.com/casperhsia/dataScience_hw/tree/master/hw02).

## Plot packages
I used ggplot2 and [scatterD3](https://rawgit.com/juba/scatterD3/master/vignettes%2Fintroduction.html). 

## Results
